This file contains information about how the AI coded in file zia.c works.
Comments inside the source code are useful, but here is a full description.

Variables prevx and prevy (float*) are arrays allocated in zia_init and
freed in zia_clear. They have one entry per zombie possible entity (total
amount = ZOMBIE_ZOMBIE_QUAN in zombie.h). They are meant to contain the
previous positions of each zombie entity. A value of -1 in prevx means
the entity was deleted: even if there's a new entity in place, the arrays
will count as nonexistent. 

Function zia_init should be called at the beginning of the program
(preferably at the initialization function, if any) and performs tasks
to prepare the AI for running. Currently:

 - Allocate memory for (and set to empty) prevx and prevy.

Function zia_run is called every tick for updating zombie movement.
It is the main function and calls most of the others.
Currently:

 - Move zombies towards player.

Function zia_clear must be called if zia_init was inside the program.
It performs memory-freeing and other tasks for shutting up the AI.
AI functions should not be called (except zia_init) after this one.
Currently:

 - Free memory in (and set to NULL) prevx and prevy.
